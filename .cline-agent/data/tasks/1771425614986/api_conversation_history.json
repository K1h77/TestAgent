Take a screenshot of the switch and also of darkmode being activated. ## Progress So Far Here is the git diff of changes already made: ```diff ?? .cline-agent/ ?? .cline-vision/ ?? .github/scripts/lib/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-312.pyc ?? .github/scripts/lib/__pycache__/agent_config.cpython-312.pyc ?? .github/scripts/lib/__pycache__/cline_runner.cpython-312.pyc ?? .github/scripts/lib/__pycache__/git_ops.cpython-312.pyc ?? .github/scripts/lib/__pycache__/issue_parser.cpython-312.pyc ?? .github/scripts/lib/__pycache__/logging_config.cpython-312.pyc ?? .github/scripts/lib/__pycache__/screenshot.cpython-312.pyc ?? .github/scripts/tests/__pycache__/__init__.cpython-312.pyc ?? .github/scripts/tests/__pycache__/test_cline_runner.cpython-312-pytest-9.0.2.pyc ?? .github/scripts/tests/__pycache__/test_git_ops.cpython-312-pytest-9.0.2.pyc ?? .github/scripts/tests/__pycache__/test_issue_parser.cpython-312-pytest-9.0.2.pyc ?? .github/scripts/tests/__pycache__/test_screenshot.cpython-312-pytest-9.0.2.pyc ``` ## Test Results ``` > testagent@1.0.0 test > npx jest --passWithNoTests && npx playwright test --reporter=list No tests found, exiting with code 0 npm warn exec The following package was not found and will be installed: jest@30.2.0 npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory.

Review the diff above to understand what was already done 2. If tests are failing, fix the implementation (not the tests) 3. If tests don't exist yet, create them following the TDD process 4. If implementation is incomplete, finish it 5. Run tests to verify everything passes: ```bash cd backend && npx jest --passWithNoTests npx playwright test ``` ## Rules - Do NOT redo work that's already done (check the diff) - Do NOT delete or rewrite files that are already correct - Fix implementation, not test expectations - Keep changes minimal and focused on the issue\n</task>"},{"type":"text","text":"\n# task_progress RECOMMENDED\n\nWhen starting a new task, it is recommended to include a todo list using the task_progress parameter.\n\n\n1.
