Take a screenshot of the switch and also of darkmode being activated. ## Step 1 — Take the after screenshot 1. Launch a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 2. If a login form is present, log in with username 'testuser' and password 'password' 3. Navigate to the relevant page and interact with the feature described in the issue (e.g. click the toggle, open the modal). Use only the app's own navigation. 4. Take a full-page screenshot and save it to: ## Step 2 — Visual QA review Now look at the screenshot you just took and answer these questions: - Is the feature described in the issue clearly visible and working in the screenshot? - Are there any obvious visual glitches? (broken layout, overlapping elements, blank/white page, missing content, severe CSS issues, console errors visible on screen) Be lenient — only flag clear, obvious problems. Minor styling differences are fine. ## Step 3 — Write verdict to file Write a short verdict to the file: /home/runner/work/TestAgent/TestAgent/screenshots/visual_verdict.txt The file must contain exactly one of these verdicts on the first line, followed by an optional short explanation: VISUAL: OK VISUAL: FEATURE_NOT_FOUND - <what you expected to see but didn't> VISUAL: ISSUE - <brief description of the glitch or problem> Example file contents: VISUAL: ISSUE - Dark mode toggle is present but the page background stays white after clicking it IMPORTANT: Use only Playwright MCP tools.
