Just navigate to where it would logically appear and take the screenshot as-is. - If this is an 'after' screenshot: the feature should now be implemented. Interact with it (e.g. click the toggle, open the modal, trigger the UI state) so the screenshot shows it working. 4.

Take a screenshot of the switch and also of darkmode being activated. ## Step 1 — Take the after screenshot 1. Launch a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 2.

Take a full-page screenshot and save it to: ## Step 2 — Visual QA review Now look at the screenshot you just took and answer these questions: - Is the feature described in the issue clearly visible and working in the screenshot? - Are there any obvious visual glitches? (broken layout, overlapping elements, blank/white page, missing content, severe CSS issues, console errors visible on screen) Be lenient — only flag clear, obvious problems. Minor styling differences are fine. ## Step 3 — Write verdict to file Write a short verdict to the file: /home/runner/work/TestAgent/TestAgent/screenshots/visual_verdict.txt The file must contain exactly one of these verdicts on the first line, followed by an optional short explanation: VISUAL: OK VISUAL: FEATURE_NOT_FOUND - <what you expected to see but didn't> VISUAL: ISSUE - <brief description of the glitch or problem> Example file contents: VISUAL: ISSUE - Dark mode toggle is present but the page background stays white after clicking it IMPORTANT: Use only Playwright MCP tools.
